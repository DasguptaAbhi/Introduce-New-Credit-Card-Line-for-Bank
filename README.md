# Mitron Bank Credit Card Analysis
## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
Mitron Bank, a legacy financial institution based in Hyderabad, is looking to introduce a new line of credit cards to expand its product offerings and improve market reach. AtliQ Data Services, a consulting firm, proposed to help with this project, but before being awarded the full contract, they were asked to conduct a pilot study.
The provided dataset contains records of 4,000 customers across five cities, detailing their online spending habits and demographic information. The primary objective of this project is to analyze the sample data and generate actionable insights to guide the bank's product strategy team in tailoring the new credit cards to customer needs and market trends.

Peter Pandey, a data analyst at AtliQ, is responsible for this analysis and will present key findings to the strategy team at Mitron Bank. His success in this pilot will determine whether AtliQ wins the larger project.

### Problem Statement
Mitron Bank is exploring ways to increase its presence in the financial market by introducing new credit card products. The challenge is to analyze the customer data, understand spending behavior, and identify target customer segments most likely to adopt and use the new credit cards. The analysis should be comprehensive, data-driven, and include insights into customer demographics, income utilization, and spending patterns to recommend features for the new credit cards.

### Objectives
1. Demographic Classification:  Classify customers based on available demographic data such as age, gender, occupation, etc., and generate insights to segment the target audience.

2. Average Income Utilization:   Calculate the key metric, Avg Income Utilization % (avg_spends/avg_income). Customers with higher utilization rates are more likely to use credit cards frequently, making this a crucial indicator.

3. Spending Insights:    Understand where customers spend the most money, and whether factors like occupation, gender, city, and age affect their spending patterns.

4. Key Customer Segments:  Identify and profile high-value customer segments who are most likely to be heavy users of the new credit cards based on spending behavior and demographics.

5. Credit Card Feature Recommendations:   Based on the data insights and secondary research, recommend credit card features that will appeal to specific target segments and increase the likelihood of card adoption.


### Metrics & Analysis
The following key metrics will be calculated and visualized:

 *Avg Income Utilization %:    A crucial measure to determine the potential of customers to use the credit card.

* Spending Patterns by Demographic Groups:     Analyzing how different segments (e.g., by occupation, city, or age) allocate their spending.

* Customer Segments:     Identifying the key segments likely to be high-value users based on the above metrics.

### Dashboard & Visualizations
The insights and metrics will be presented through an interactive dashboard designed for top-level management and the product strategy team. The dashboard will include:

* Customer Demographic Analysis:   Visualizing customer demographics and income & spend
